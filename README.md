# Random Posts

This is a place to store random posts that don't have to do with finance—random finance posts are [here](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts). So far:
* [Derivative of the sigmoid function](derivative_sigmoid.ipynb): This notebook walks through a step-by-step derivation of the derivative of the sigmoid function. Often, the derivative is initially stated as a given in machine learning and deep learning courses—this is for those interested in the detail of the derivation. The notebook is also referred to in subsequent posts.
* [Derive parameters for simple linear regression (OLS)](simple_regression_ols.ipynb): This notebook walks through a step-by-step derivation of the derivative of the sigmoid function. Often, the derivative is initially stated as a given in machine learning and deep learning courses—this is for those interested in the detail of the derivation. The notebook is also referred to in subsequent posts.
