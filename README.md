# Random Posts

This is a place to store random posts that don't have to do with finance—random finance posts are [here](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts). So far:
* [Step-by-step derivative of the sigmoid function](derivative_sigmoid.ipynb): This notebook walks through a step-by-step derivation of the derivative of the sigmoid function. Often, the derivative is initially stated as a given in machine learning and deep learning courses—this is for those interested in the detail of the derivation.
* [Step-by-step derivation of OLS estimates for simple linear regression](simple_regression_ols.ipynb): This notebook walks through a step-by-step derivation of the OLS estimates of the parameters for simple linear regression. Often, simple linear regression is used early on in machine learning courses—this is for those interested in the detail of the derivation.
