# Notes on *Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python*
This is a place to share notes on my read through *Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python*, which text is available [here](https://www.statlearning.com/).

* [Walking through the reducible/irreducible error math on page 28](reducible_math): On page 28/613, when discussing the difference between reducible and irreducible error, the text notes that $E(Y-\hat{Y})^2=\big(f(X)-\hat{f}(X)\big)^2+Var(\varepsilon)$, stating this equality is "easy to show". This post walks through how to do so.
